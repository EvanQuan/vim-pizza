## Description
A python version of arithran's initial attempt at trying to order pizza from within vim. 

## But Why?
I stumbeled on arithran's idea and thought it was funny so here's my take on it.

## Usage
	:PyPizz

**If you are always hungry, add the following to your .vimrc to bind a key like F5**

	nnoremap <F5> :PyPizz<CR>

**I always order Papa John's Pan Cheese, but this plug-in always takes me to the Pizza Hut homepage** (It can be any pizza URL you visit frequently)

	let g:vim_pizza_url ='https://www.papajohns.com/order/builder/productBuilderInfo?productGroupId=pan-cheese&productSKU.sku=1-296-3-83&quantity=1'


## Installation
Just download the files and copy them into you `~/.vim` directory.
